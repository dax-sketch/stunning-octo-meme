# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical issues in the current dashboard implementation: non-functional quick action buttons and missing role change functionality. The quick actions currently navigate to non-existent routes, and users have no way to request role changes within the application. This enhancement will fix the quick actions and add a comprehensive role management system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Quick Actions Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quick action buttons on the dashboard to work properly, so that I can quickly access key functionality without encountering navigation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Add Company" THEN the system SHALL navigate to a functional company creation page
2. WHEN a user clicks "View Companies" THEN the system SHALL navigate to a functional companies list page  
3. WHEN a user clicks "Schedule Audit" THEN the system SHALL navigate to a functional audit scheduling page
4. WHEN a user clicks "Notifications" THEN the system SHALL navigate to a functional notifications page
5. IF a route does not exist THEN the system SHALL create the necessary page components and routes
6. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper authentication and authorization

### Requirement 2: Role Change Request System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to request a role change within the application, so that I can access appropriate functionality for my responsibilities without contacting administrators externally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display their current role prominently
2. WHEN a user wants to request a role change THEN the system SHALL provide a "Request Role Change" button or option
3. WHEN a user clicks "Request Role Change" THEN the system SHALL open a role change request form
4. WHEN submitting a role change request THEN the system SHALL require a business justification
5. WHEN a role change request is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the request with pending status
6. WHEN a role change request is submitted THEN the system SHALL notify administrators via the notification system
7. WHEN a user has a pending role change request THEN the system SHALL display the pending status in their profile
8. WHEN a user has a pending request THEN the system SHALL prevent submitting additional requests until resolved

### Requirement 3: Role Change Administration

**User Story:** As an administrator (CEO/MANAGER), I want to review and approve/deny role change requests, so that I can maintain proper access control and organizational structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display pending role change requests in a dedicated section
2. WHEN an administrator views a role change request THEN the system SHALL show the requester's details, current role, requested role, and justification
3. WHEN an administrator approves a role change THEN the system SHALL update the user's role immediately
4. WHEN an administrator denies a role change THEN the system SHALL record the denial reason
5. WHEN a role change is approved or denied THEN the system SHALL notify the requester via the notification system
6. WHEN a role change is processed THEN the system SHALL create an audit log entry
7. IF a user is not an administrator THEN the system SHALL NOT display role change administration features

### Requirement 4: Enhanced User Profile Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive role information in my profile, so that I understand my current permissions and can track any pending role changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their profile THEN the system SHALL display current role with a clear label
2. WHEN a user has role-based permissions THEN the system SHALL display what actions their role allows
3. WHEN a user has a pending role change request THEN the system SHALL display the pending status with submission date
4. WHEN a user views role information THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions of each role level
5. WHEN displaying role information THEN the system SHALL use consistent terminology throughout the application
